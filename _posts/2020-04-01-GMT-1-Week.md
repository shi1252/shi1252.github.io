# Kinds of Number
<hr/>

## Helpful information before read
### Closed Operations
Closed operation means a operation satisfied that the arguments of the operator and the result of it are included in same number system.

### Field
<ul>
<li>Closed set to addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.</li>
<li>Has identities, inverses of addition and multiplication.</li>
<li>Satisfy commutativity, associativity, distributivity.</li>
</ul>
Example: Rational Number <b>Q</b>, Real Number <b>R</b>, Complex Number <b>C</b>.

<hr/>

## Natural Number
This is the number that we can count how many it is. Such as ```(0,) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...```<br>
The symbol of natural number is <b>N</b>.<br>
### Peano axiom: which doesn't include 0 in natural number.
<ul>
<b>N</b>={1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
<li><b>N</b> has special element called 1.</li>
<li>There is a number x inside of <b>N</b>.<br>Then x<sup>+</sup>(the next number of the 'x') is also a number of <b>N</b>.</li>
<li>There is no element which has 1 as a next number inside of <b>N</b>.</li>
<li>Let there are elements x, y, z included <b>N</b>.<br>If 'x = z', 'y = z' then 'x = y'.</li>
<li>If a subset S of <b>N</b> satisfied 1‚ààS, x‚ààS, x<sup>+</sup>‚ààS. Then S=<b>N</b></li>
</ul>

### Whole numbers axiom: which includes 0 in natural number.
<ul>
<b>N</b>={0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
<li><b>N</b> has special element called 0.</li>
<li>There is a number x inside of <b>N</b>.<br>Then x<sup>+</sup>(the next number of the 'x') is also a number of <b>N</b>.</li>
<li>There is no element which has 0 as a next number inside of <b>N</b>.</li>
<li>Let there are elements x, y, z included <b>N</b>.<br>If 'x = z', 'y = z' then 'x = y'.</li>
<li>If a subset S of <b>N</b> satisfied 0‚ààS, x‚ààS, x<sup>+</sup>‚ààS. Then S=<b>N</b></li>
</ul>

### Addition of Natural number
Case 1: 0 is not included

</div>
<ul>
<li>1 + 1 = 1<sup>+</sup></li>
<li>1<sup>+</sup> = 2</li>
<li>‚à¥ 1 + 1 = 2</li>
</ul>
Case 2: 0 is included<br>
<div class = "box">
1') Let n (n‚àà<b>N</b>). n satisfies n + 0 = n
</div>
<ul><li>1 + 1 = 1 + (0<sup>+</sup>) = (1 + 0)<sup>+</sup> = 1<sup>+</sup> = 2</li></ul>

### Multiplication of Natural number
Case 1: 0 is not included
<div class = "box">
1) Let n (n‚àà<b>N</b>). n satisfies n √ó 1 = n<br>
2) Let m, n (m‚àà<b>N</b>, n‚àà<b>N</b>). m √ó n<sup>+</sup> = m √ó n + m
</div>
<ul>
<li>1 √ó 2 = 1 √ó (1<sup>+</sup>) = 1 √ó 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2</li>
</ul>
Case 2: 0 is included<br>
<div class = "box">
1') Let n (n‚àà<b>N</b>). n satisfies n √ó 0 = 0
</div>

### Closed operations of Natural number

## Integer
### Definition

# Number Set

<hr/>

## Finite Set
This is a number set which has finite number of count of the included elements. Such as ```{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}```
## Infinite Set
This is a number set which has infinite number of count of the included elements. Such as ```{1, 2, 3, ..., 8744, ...}```
<hr/>

# Vector
Vector is an element of a vector space.<br>
Usually it described by tuple. Such as ```(2, 6.4)```<br>
And the element of the vector satisfies field. Usually the element is <b>R</b>.
<hr/>

## Tuple
Finite ordered sequence of elements. Such as ```(1, 3, 2, 2)```

## Scalar
Number that can described by its own magnitude at the n-dimensions.<br>
Which means it doesn't affected by dimension.<br>
Such as ```1, œÄ, 2 / 3, ...```

## Vector Operation
### Vector Addition
<div class = "box">
Let vector <b>v</b> = (a, b), <b>w</b> = (c, d)<br>
<b>v</b> + <b>w</b> = (a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)
</div>

### Scalar Multiplication
<div class = "box">
Let vector <b>v</b> = (a, b), scalar c<br>
c √ó <b>v</b> = c √ó (a, b) = (ca, cb)
</div>

<hr/>

# Vector Space
Let there are vector satisfied same n-tuple and the elements is in a same field.<br>
If there are infinite number of vector then it makes Vector Space.

<hr/>

Let arbitrary vectors <b>u</b>, <b>v</b>, and <b>w</b> in <i>V</i> which is comprising field <i>F</i>, and <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> scalars in <i>F</i>.

## Associativity
<b>u</b> + (<b>v</b> + <b>w</b>) = (<b>u</b> + <b>v</b>) + <b>w</b>

## Commutativity
<b>u</b> + <b>v</b> = <b>v</b> + <b>u</b>

## Distributity
<i>a</i>(<b>u</b> + <b>v</b>) = <i>a</i><b>u</b> + <i>a</i><b>v</b>
(<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>)<b>v</b> = <i>a</i><b>v</b> + <i>b</i><b>v</b>

## Compatibility
<i>a</i>(<i>b</i><b>v</b>) = (<i>a</i><i>b</i>)<b>v</b>

## Identity
### Identity element of vector addition
There is zero vector <b>0</b>. <b>v</b> + <b>0</b> = <b>v</b>.
### Identity element of scalar multiplication
1<b>v</b> = <b>v</b>

## Inverse of vector addition
<i>a</i>(<i>b</i><b>v</b>) = (<i>a</i><i>b</i>)<b>v</b>

# Cartesian Product

<hr/>

<b>A</b> √ó <b>B</b> = {(a, b)|a‚àà<b>A</b>, b‚àà<b>B</b>}.<br>

An example of cartesian product.<br>
<b>A</b> √ó <b>B</b>. <b>A</b> = {‚ô†, ‚ô•, üçÄ, ‚óÜ}, <b>B</b> = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A}

## Cartesian Coordinate System
We can describe <b>R</b> as a line.<br>
Let vector (<b>R</b>, <b>R</b>)<br>
Then it can be described by 2 lines like the image on the right.
